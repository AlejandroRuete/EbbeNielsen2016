<h4>Ignorance Explorer</h4>

<p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>This interactive application exemplifies the use of the half-ignorance algorithm <abbr title="Ruete A. 2015. Displaying bias in sampling effort of data accessed from biodiversity databases using ignorance maps. Biodiversity Data Journal 3:e5361">[1]</abbr> 
to map the ignorance (i.e. bias and lack of sampling effort) found in the 
observations stored at the Global biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
<a href="http://www.www.gbif.org">www.gbif.org</a>. and downloaded in any of the many ways detailed in the  <a href="https://github.com/AlejandroRuete/IgnoranceMaps2">general description of this tutorial</a></p>

<p>This example focus on Europe using Ampphibians as the reference taxonomic group (RTG). 
In the first tab &quot;<b>Spatial Bias</b>&quot; we look at the bias purely over space. 
Here, we also include data for <i>Rana temporaria</i> as a focal species. Note 
that this is a common species and is, therefore, not allways reported as enthusiastically 
as other rarer species are. In order to illustrate this spatial bias in observations 
the best estimate of the species distribution according to the IUCN 
<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data">http://www.iucnredlist.org</a> 
is plotted in black. The O<sub>0.5</sub> parameter defines the number of observations required to to decrease the ignorance score to 0.5 (see the reference above). Here, in order to do comparizon among scales easier, this parameter is defined scale dependent, that is, relative to the minimun resolution available(O<sub>0.5</sub> = 1 @25km <=> 
O<sub>0.5</sub> = 16 @100km). When the <em>Observation Index</em> is used instead of raw number of observations, observations are relative to the observed number of species in the same grid cell.</p>

<p>From the <em>Layers</em> selector you can switch between:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>RTG Ignorance Map (0 = enough knowledge, 1 = complete ignorance)</li>
  <li>Species Ignorance Map</li>
  <li>Population Size Index <abbr title="Jeppsson T., et al. 2010. The use of historical collections to estimate population trends: A case study using Swedish longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Biological Conservation. 143, 1940-1950.">[2]</abbr> (i.e. the odds of observing the species in a random sample of all observed species) </li>
  <li>Species Presence-Absence Map, an example of how and where Presence-Absence could be infered only from available data</li>
</ol>
<p>In the later layer, cells are coloured green when the species has been observed with an ignorance lower the  value set by the slider <em>Max Ignorance for Presence</em>. That is, if the  O<sub>0.5</sub> <i>Rana temporaria</i> is set to 1 and resolution to 100 km, then 16 observations are required per 100 km grid cell for ignorance to decrease to 0.5. Then, if <em>Max Ignorance for Presence</em> is set to 0.5, cells where there were 16 observation of the species or more will be coloured green. Else, given the assumptions, there is not enough certainty about the presence of the species. If O<sub>0.5</sub> <i>Rana temporaria</i> is set to 0.05, only 1 observation is required per grid cell to reduce the ignorance to 0.5. Then, every cell where <i>Rana temporaria</i> was observed at least once will be green. Inverselly, cells are coloured red if observations are &quot;enough&quot;for the RTG , but there where not enough for the species. Red cells get lighter the less knowledge there is about the RTG, up to a point where absences of the species are equally likely than lack of observations. Cell where ignorance is higher than 0.5 are not coloured in this layer as nothing can be said about the species (or RTG) based only on the data.</p>

<p>Only ignorance scores for the RTG is explored in the second tab &quot;<b>Temporal and Grouped Bias</b>&quot;. The options here are similar to the previous tab. However, here ignorance is sliced trough time, and group by country at different resolutions. The aim is to explore when and where were observations collected. For agility reasons the temporal analysis is done onnly with 100 km grids cells. However, the resolution analysis uses allways all observations. Here we can see the influence of data without a specified year of collection, summarize ignorance scores per country, rank them, and compare how does mean ignorance change at difference resolutions. In general, if observation indices are used, and the number of cells is high enough not to bias the average, variation in ignorance scores among different resolutions reflects the evenness in sampling effort across the country.</p>
<p>Similar summaries could be done to compare any area of interest e.g. ecoregions or biomes.</p>
